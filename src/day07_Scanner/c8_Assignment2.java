        //
        System.out.println("Enter first number");

//Question 5
        //Positive, negative or zero
        //Write a program that prompts the user to input a number.
        // The program should then output the number and a message saying whether
        // the number is positive, negative, or zero.



        //Question 6
//
//Valid Triangle
//A triangle is valid if the sum of all the three angles is equal to 180 degrees.
// Write a program that asks the user to enter three integers as angles and
// check whether a triangle is valid or not.
//


        //Question 7
        //Leap Year
        //Any year is input by the user. Write a program to determine whether the year is a leap year or not.
        //Leap Years are any year that can be evenly divided by 4.
        // A year that is evenly divisible by 100 is a leap year only if it is also evenly divisible by 400.
        //
        //Example :
        //1992      Leap Year
        //2000      Leap Year
        //1900      NOT a Leap Year

        //Question 8

//Telephone Bill
//Write a program to calculate the monthly telephone bills as per the following rule:
//Minimum Rs. 200 for up to 100 calls.
//Plus Rs. 0.60 per call for next 50 calls.
//Plus Rs. 0.50 per call for next 50 calls.
//Plus Rs. 0.40 per call for any call beyond 200 calls.



        //Question 9
//Grade Calculator
//The marks obtained by a student in 3 different subjects are input by the user.
// Your program should calculate the average of subjects. The student gets a grade as per the following rules:
//Average
//Grade
//
//90-100  A
//80-89   B
//70-79   C
//60-69   D
//0-59    F
//



        //Question 10
//Meaning of Grade
//Write a program that prompts the user to enter grade.
// Your program should display the corresponding meaning of grade as per the following table
//
//Grade    Meaning
//A        Excellent
//
//B        Good
//
//C        Average
//
//D        Deficient
//
//F        Failing




        //Question 11
//
